Overview
The Automated Resume Parser System is a tool designed to streamline the process of extracting relevant information from resumes. This system uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to parse resumes and extract key details such as personal information, skills, work experience, education, and more. The extracted data can then be used for various purposes, such as populating databases, assisting in the recruitment process, or generating summaries.
